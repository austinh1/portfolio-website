                        <p>Technically my first name Steven, but everyone calls me by my middle name, Austin. Since I
                            was very
                            young I've had an interest in making games, but it wasn't until I got my hands on a now
                            famous piece of sofware called Game Maker that I was finally given the tools to explore my
                            passion. I made so many very bad games in Game Maker, and unfortunately (or maybe
                            fortunately) those old games have been lost to time, probably on a laptop hard drive in some
                            landfill in Cininnati. Ever since then game dev has be an integral part of my life and I
                            finally picked up Unity while I was at Northern Kentucky University pursuing a degree in
                            Computer Science. From there I went off to make quite a few games, notably Match Point and
                            most recently Franchise Wars, both of which you can find on Steam!</p>
                        <br />
                        <h2 class="subtitle">Do you have other interests?</h2>
                        <p>I'm glad you asked! I have so many I'm not even sure where to start. Language learning is
                            probably my second biggest hobby outside of game development. I started learning German when
                            I was only 15 years old, though at first I honestly didn't really like German. Instead I
                            wanted to learn
                            something like Chinese or Japanese. But I stuck with it and seven years later I'm so glad I
                            did. I can now speak the language fluently, though I still haven't managed to get rid of
                            that
                            pesky American accent, and I've met so many new friends along the way. Since learning German
                            I've also decided to pick up Japanese as my next language learning challenge! Of course,
                            with learning all of these languages I also tend to travel a lot. In fact, the picture above
                            comes from a small town in Austria call Zillertal.</p>
                        <br />
                        <p>Besides language learning, I also like to fiddle with VR, play video games of course and
                            mountain bike as much as I humanly can. I also really enjoy a good cup of coffee.</p>
                        <br />
                        <h2 class="subtitle">Hey, I have similar interests! Can we work together?</h2>
                        <p>Heck yeah! Don't hesitate to get in contact. I'm always looking for new friends to work on
                            projects together. The best way to get a hold of me is probably through facebook, though I
                            check my other social media accounts from time to time.</p>
